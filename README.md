# Portfolio 2018 

This is my current portfolio located at [jessereitz.com](http://www.jessereitz.com "Jesse Reitz | Web Developer").  

## Design

This portfolio uses my [branding libraries](https://github.com/jessereitz/branding) for its main styles and for creation of the navigation menu.
Of course, there are site-specific styles as well. I use [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for easy contact form submission.
